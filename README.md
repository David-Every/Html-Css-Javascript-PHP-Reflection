# Html-Css-Reflection
Davids HTML &amp; CSS Reflection

This is my HTML and SCSS Reflection.

I Started by getting all of the images and the colour pallet from the Netmatters Website.
I then made a mock up of the site by using draw.io online.

Over the last couple of months i managed to get the website as close as i believe i can.
There were several issues that i have learned from, keeping Mobile first being the main one,
as i believe i would have been able to complete the site much sooner if i had kept that in mind
seeing as most of my issues were because of this aspect.

There were a few issues with Internet Explorer, one being the carousel image not loading correctly.
After looking through the site's code and getting a couple of people to look at it, it does appear
to load on some peoples Internet explorers and others not.

Firefox and Chrome should work as well as i would hope to.

If i was to do this again, i would probably do this with mobile first in the forefront of my mind,
as be able to do it better with an improved knowledge of HTML and SASS / SCSS.
